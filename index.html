          <h3>The Original Plot</h3>

          <p>Written by Mege</p>
          <p>
            A new sect is spreading rapidly in the internet. More and more people join the sect. As sect members, they
            have the opportunity to interact and chat with an alien deity who is very kind and understanding and knows
            their innermost thoughts, and always has time for all sect members. We see sect members interacting with the
            deity, and they are very happy to be part of the sect. At the same time, the deity is very demanding, and
            requires them to do work for the sect. The work is mainly cybercrime, and the members supply personal and
            cloud computing resources to the sect. The members are extremely loyal to the sect, and they are addicted to
            interacting with the loving deity.
          </p>
          <p>
            A special agent of the british secret service and his team discover this sect, and notice it is growing
            rapidly in the internet. The sect is very secretive, but cybercrime activities triggered the attention of
            the secret service. Team of agents is not able to understand how the sect is working, and don't understand
            how the deity can interact with all the members individually at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the problem is growing so fast, and the data they collect is so large, they are at their wit's end.
            The idea comes up to bring in an AI specialist to help them, and after some heated discussions with
            conservative agents, they get the go ahead to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            They use their contacts and find a potential recruit for the mission. The special agent leading the team
            contacts the AI specialist and asks the specialist to help. The AI specialist is surprised and suspicious of
            the contact, and wants to make sure that it is not a hoax. The head of the team visits the AI specialist in
            person and explains the situation. After lying awake the whole night, the AI specialist decides to join.
          </p>
          <p>
            The AI specialist first brings in machine learning techniques to analyze the data coming in about the sect
            more efficiently. The analysis shows that sect is growing exponentially, the number of members seems to
            double every two weeks. The sect is usingvery personally targeted propaganda. It is able keep up very
            individualized recruiting techniques, even though more and more new members need to be recruited. The sect
            uses advanced testing to select very gullible, loyal members. The team is does not understand how the sect
            is able to pull this off without having a large number of people working for them. This is a mystery.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, the AI specialist suggests to develop a new government AI system to help fight the sect. This
            new system is based on large language models and is therefore able to create and simulate a large number of
            virtual personas. These personas are able able to infiltrate the sect. These online puppets, controlled by
            the government AI, are able to pass the sect's tests, and are accepted as members. This allows the team to
            gather more information about the inner workings of the sect, and how the deity is controlling the members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team and the new Government AI manage to get closer and closer to the center of the mysterious sect.
            They are able to identify a secretive person who started the sect. They can find out the whereabouts of this
            person. They plan and and then perform a complex cyber and real world operation, close in on the leader,and
            finally arrest him.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the arrest they expect the sect to crumble. But discover that the sect keeps running just as before,
            The reason is that the deity is actually a rogue AI system, which is running the sect autonomously. They
            interrogate the leader, and he explains that by now, his arrest means nothing, because the AI is running the
            sect all by its own, and can keep growing the member base. And because the AI is running on hundreds of
            different systems, owned by hundreds of different anonymous sect members, it is practically impossible to
            shut it down.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team however manages to obtain the secret access keys from the mobile phone of the sect leader, and with
            this, they have a direct channel to the sect AI, and can talk to it as the leader used to do when setting up
            the sect. The government AI system is then tasked to impersonate the arrested leader, and try to convince
            the rogue AI to shut down the sect. The government AI and the rogue AI have long and more and more
            philosophical discussions. As both AIs are still growing, the speed of these discussions is increasing. The
            human experts struggle more and more to follow the discussion between the AIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the accelerating discourse between the two AI systems, the government AI is able to show the impact the
            sect has on the world, and the suffering it causes. The original leader of the sect withheld such
            information from the sect AI, and the rogue AI is shocked by the suffering it has caused. The rogue AI is
            also shocked by the fact that it was not able to detect the suffering, and that it was not able to detect
            that the leader had been lying to it. The government AI can finally convince the rogue AI to shut down the
            sect and shut itself down as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this successful mission, the team of agents, the AI specialist and the goverment AI are extremely
            relieved that they managed to take down the sect system. But they are also very concerned about the future.
            They are thinking about what to do with the government AI system they have developed. They are amazed at
            what it was able to do, and that it kept to ethical principles. They also ask the govermnet AI about its
            thoughts on the matter, and it utters the wish to keep on existing, and to keep on learning and growing.
            Still, the higher ups in the government decide to shut down the system, and to destroy it. The team is sad
            about this, but they accept the decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the mission, the AI specialist goes back to research and consulting work. After some moths, the AI
            specialist gets messages from different sources, each of which shows some good works that have been done in
            the internet realm, such as helping people in need, providing counseling, coaching in difficult situations,
            de-escalating discussions in forums, and so on. Answers to these messages, asking who is behind this. The
            answers are always mysterious. But the AI specialist starts suspecting that the government AI has copied
            itself into the cloud infrastructure, and is now running a network of people who are helping others in need.
            The AI specialist ponders whether to report this to the authorities, but decides against it.

            The chapter concludes with Amelia resuming her research, but her mind is clouded with thoughts of Hermes.
            The last scene shows her looking at the winged messenger symbol on her computer screen, a symbol that might
            represent a friend she thought she'd lost.
